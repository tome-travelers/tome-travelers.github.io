                        Info 1 – That label displays your name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Info 2 – This is your battle health bar and decreases when you take damage in battle.
                        You can replenish your battle health bar with items you find in the dungeon.
                        If your battle health bar reaches zero, the battle is lost and you deplete one chunk of your
                        life meter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Info 3 – This is your battle speed bar. It slowly fills up during the battle depending on your
                        speed. If it is fully charged, then it's your turn and you can use items and attack the enemy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Info 4 – These are your available attacks. You can equip one attack per level and you can change
                        the attacks during a battle when it's your turn. A green frame around one attack indicates that
                        it's ready to be used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Info 5 – Level 3 and level 4 attacks need to be charged before they are ready to be used. When
                        you use level 1 and level 2 attacks you can charge up the more powerful attacks. As long as you
                        see a (partially) red frame around an attack, it's not ready yet and still needs to be charged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Info 6 – If you don't have an attack for a particular level equipped, then you see this
                        placeholder symbol. Find and equip an attack to make this slot available.
                    </p>

                        If the enemy's battle health bar reaches zero, the enemy dies and won't participate in the
                        battle anymore. If all enemies in a battle are defeated you will win the battle and obtain
                        useful battle spoils afterwards.

                    <p>
                        Info 3 – This is the enemy's battle speed bar. It slowly fills up during the battle depending on
                        the enemy's speed. If it is fully charged, then it's the enemy's turn and they will attack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Info 4 – This tiny indicator marks the currently selected enemy. When it's your turn you can
                        change the selection. If your attack targets all enemies, then the selection does not matter.
                        You can't select defeated enemies.

                        There are seven different elements that have an influence on how strong an attack is.
                        Each element has certain strengths and weaknesses. Observe enemy's appearance, names, and
                        attacks that might reveal their elements. Use your knowledge collected this way to your
                        advantage in battles against particularly strong enemies.

                        You can move around the world freely. However, you need a ship to cross water. During your
                        journey across the world you sometimes stumble upon useful resources like rocks, wood, insects,
                        eggs, or fish.

                        There are a towns scattered across the continents. In these towns you can restock on potions at
                        the market or sell resources you collected. Also it's always a good idea to stop by the local
                        inn and listen to the gossip.

                        The cave icons represent dungeons. Having a silver crown on the cave icon means that you

                        completely explored the dungeon. The light purple crown marks all completely explored dungeons
